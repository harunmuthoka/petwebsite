<h1>puppy</h1>
<p>A puppy is a juvenile dog. Some puppies can weigh 1–1.5 kg (1-3 lb), <br>  while larger ones can weigh up to 7–11 kg (15-23 lb). <br> All healthy puppies grow quickly after birth. <br> A puppy's coat color may change as the puppy grows older, <br> as is commonly seen in breeds such as the Yorkshire Terrier. <br> Puppy refers specifically to young dogs, <br> while pup may be used for other animals such as wolves, seals, giraffes, guinea pigs, rats or sharks.[2]</p>
